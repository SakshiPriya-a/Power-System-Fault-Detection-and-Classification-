# 💡 Project Overview: Power System Fault Detection
# 🔍 Problem Statement
In a power distribution system, detecting faults quickly and accurately is critical to prevent outages and maintain grid stability. The task was to build a machine learning model that classifies operating conditions—normal, line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase faults—using voltage and current phasor data.

# ✅ Solution Approach
An end-to-end ML pipeline was built to classify faults based on labeled electrical data. The solution included preprocessing, training a classifier, evaluating its accuracy, and deploying it as an online prediction service on IBM Cloud.

# ⚙️ Technology Stack
Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud

ML Tools: IBM Watson Studio, IBM AutoAI

Modeling: Random Forest classifier used for fault classification

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

Deployment:

Model deployed using IBM Watson Studio

Exposed via REST API for real-time predictions

Testing: Sample inputs were tested through the API to verify real-time classification

# 📊 Results
Model Accuracy: 95%+ on test data

Best Performing Algorithm: Random Forest

Deployment: Successful real-time API-based fault classification on IBM Cloud

Impact: Enables faster and automated fault diagnosis in smart grid systems
